Started working on TempoDay, a calendar-centric personal management app. The concept is simple but powerful: see all your tasks, notes, and finances for any day in one unified view.

Today's focus was on planning and research:
- Defined MVP scope with 3 core sections
- Researched Svelte 5 and modern web technologies
- Created initial project structure
- Set up the development workflow

Excited to build something that actually helps with daily organization!

Next: Database architecture and schema design.`,
        date: dates[0],
      },
      {
        content: `Day 2 - Database Foundation üíæ

Deep dive into the data layer today. Chose PGlite for local-first storage with the ability to sync later. Drizzle ORM is fantastic - type-safe migrations and queries.

Key decisions made:
- Local-first approach with IndexedDB persistence
- Separate tables for tasks, notes, transactions, settings
- Date-based organization (YYYY-MM-DD keys)
- Auto-migration system for schema updates

The foundation is solid. Ready to build the UI layer tomorrow.

Challenge: Balancing simplicity with extensibility for future features.`,
        date: dates[1],
      },
      {
        content: `Day 3 - UI Components Coming Together ‚ú®

Built the core Svelte components today. The calendar navigation feels smooth and the Day View layout is taking shape nicely.

Progress made:
- Calendar month/day navigation working
- Task components with checkboxes and state management
- Note editor with basic formatting
- Consistent design system with Tailwind

The app is starting to feel real! The three-section Day View layout works well on both desktop and mobile.

Tomorrow: Financial tracking features and daily summaries.`,
        date: dates[2],
      },
      {
        content: `Day 4 - Financial Tracking Features üí∞

Implemented the financial section today. It's surprisingly satisfying to see daily income/expense summaries with real-time calculations.

Features completed:
- Add income/expense transactions
- Automatic daily totals and net balance
- Clean transaction list with type indicators
- Basic transaction management (add/delete)

The manual entry approach works well for the MVP. Users can quickly log expenses as they happen throughout the day.

Need to add better error handling and polish the interactions.`,

        content: `Day 5 - Reactive State & Bug Fixes üêõ

Focused on the reactive state management system today. Switched from simple stores to a more robust repository pattern with Svelte 5 runes.

Fixed major issues:
- Infinite loop when loading empty data sets
- Proper date change handling across components
- Error states and loading indicators
- Auto-save debouncing for notes

The app feels much more stable now. The reactive system properly handles date navigation and data loading without performance issues.

Ready for some user testing to validate the core concept!`,
